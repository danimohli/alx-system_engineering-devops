Network
The network is the backbone that allows different parts of a software system to communicate with each other. It includes:

Internet Service Provider (ISP): Provides the internet connection.
Domain Name System (DNS): Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses.
Load Balancers: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server gets overwhelmed. They also improve redundancy and reliability.
Firewalls: Protect the network by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.
Servers
Servers host the software applications and handle requests from clients (users). Key aspects include:

Web Servers: Handle HTTP requests from clients. Examples include Apache and Nginx.
Application Servers: Execute application code and handle business logic. They often communicate with databases and other services.
Database Servers: Store and manage data. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
Cache Servers: Temporarily store frequently accessed data to speed up response times. Examples include Redis and Memcached.
Security
Ensuring the security of the software system is crucial. Key security measures include:

Authentication and Authorization: Ensuring users are who they say they are (authentication) and have permission to access specific resources (authorization).
Encryption: Protecting data by converting it into a code to prevent unauthorized access. This applies to data in transit (using HTTPS) and data at rest (using encryption algorithms).
Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): Monitor network and system activities for malicious activities or policy violations and take action to prevent them.
Regular Updates and Patching: Keeping software up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities.


Conclusion
Understanding the infrastructure side of a software system involves knowing how different components interact and contribute to the overall functionality and security of the system. This holistic view helps in diagnosing issues, optimizing performance, and ensuring robust security measures.
