A web server is a computer system capable of delivering web content to end users over the internet via a web browser.

How web servers work
The end user processes a request via a web browser installed on a web server. The communication between a web server or browser and the end user takes place using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The primary role of a web server is to store, process, and deliver requested information or webpages to end users. It uses:

Physical Storage: All website data is stored on a physical web server to ensure its safety. When an end user enters the URL of your website or searches it using a keyword on a browser, a request is generated and sent to the web server to process the data.

Web browser: The role of web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer is to find the web server on which your website data is located. Once the browser finds your server, it reads the request and processes the information.
