A database is information that's set up for easy access, management and updating. Computer databases typically store aggregations of data records or files that contain information such as sales transactions, customer data, financials and product information.

Databases are used for storing, maintaining and accessing any sort of data. They collect information on people, places or things. This information is gathered in one place so it can be observed and analyzed. Databases can be thought of as an organized collection of information.

Databases are essential for storing large amounts of data in one place. With databases, organizations can quickly access, manage, modify, update, organize and retrieve their data.

Databases are normally controlled using a database management system (DBMS). In the database, data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. Many databases also use Structured Query Language (SQL) for writing and querying data. There are different kinds of databases, however, so the exact language used and how it works depends on the type of database.
