It's an open-source configuration management tool used for automating the management of your infrastructure. With Puppet, you can define the desired state of your systems using a declarative language, and Puppet will ensure that your systems stay in that state.

Itâ€™s handy for tasks like:

Ensuring that specific packages are installed
Configuring services
Managing files and directories
Puppet uses a client-server model, where the client (Puppet agent) runs on your nodes and communicates with the server (Puppet master) to get the configuration data.
